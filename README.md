# Refactoring Strategies: Beyond the Basics

Code repository used for the "Refactoring Strategies: Beyong the Basics" workshop.
Presented at: Agile Brazil 2013, DevNexus 2014, Chicago Coder Conference 2016, and many ThoughtWorks offices.

## Abstract

Refactoring is a fundamental practice for an agile developer. Each refactoring is a small and isolated activity, but the value comes when you perform a sequence of refactorings to effect larger changes. This workshop will guide participants through hands-on exercises designed to teach three essential skills to become good at refactoring: 1) Identifying what needs refactoring: what makes code smell, confusing, or complex? 2) Identifying the end goal: what are the design options and which one will yield the best results? 3) Tracing a strategy to get the code from 1 to 2.

For the workshop, developers should bring their laptop with a basic working Java environment (JDK 1.6+, Eclipse or IntelliJ), have some knowledge about automated testing (JUnit) and refactorings, and optionally spend some time getting familiar with the code base.
